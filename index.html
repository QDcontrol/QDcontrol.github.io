					<div class="content"> 
						<p style="margin-bottom:10px; padding: 0px;">Compared to other quantum technologies, quantum-dot-based spin qubits show great 
							potential for scalability. They offer high readout visibility, competitive control fidelities, and a scalable semiconductor-based 
							platform. Moreover, the many degrees of freedom in tuning up a lithographically defined quantum dot device enable varied qubit 
							encodings and a rich set of primitive gates. These primitives may enable very efficient circuit-level optimization when running 
							quantum algorithms. However, these many degrees of freedom come at the cost of increased susceptibility to noise and a control 
							complexity that necessitates automated device tuning and calibration as processors scale to even a modest number of qubits. In 
							this talk, I will discuss the steps required to tune up single- and two-qubit quantum gates in a silicon quantum processor. I 
							will describe early efforts to automate the recalibration of single-qubit gates and identify key challenges in the automated 
							tune-up of multi-qubit gates and larger qubit arrays.</p>

					<button type="button" class="collapse">Applying Shuttling Optimal Control to Cryogenic Electronics</button> 
					<div class="content"> 
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px;">Spin qubit shuttling is necessary for creating scalable quantum processors 
							based on sparse qubit grid architectures. The SpinBus architecture [1] is one example of such a sparse grid that 
							allows for the integration of tailored cryogenic electronics. Generating shuttling signals in close proximity to 
							qubits mitigates the wiring bottleneck and optimizes the qubit-electronics interface in terms of cost, power, and 
							signal distortion. However, it also increases the demand for co-simulation and pre-silicon verification tools and 
							methodologies, as described in [2].</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 30px;">In particular, the adoption of optimal control theory in 
							cryogenic electronics necessitates cross-domain collaboration between quantum physicists and integrated circuit 
							designers. Our digital twin, which represents a shuttling channel and integrated control circuit, can accelerate
							collaborative development. The digital twin co-simulates the integrated circuit using a behavioral or transistor-level 
							model. It also uses a COMSOL model to calculate the electrostatic potential landscape induced by the electrical signals 
							applied to the electrodes and a quantum solver to calculate the resulting spin shuttling fidelity. This interdisciplinary 
							model encompasses most limitations associated with cryogenic electronics, such as a reduced number of waveform shapes, 
							and reduced time and amplitude resolution.</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 30px;">In the two-dimensional heterostructure of the SpinBus 
							architecture, the shape and disorder of the quantum-well confinement, influenced by alloy diffusion, generate an 
							unpredictable evolution of the electron's valley state during shuttling. In addition to this, the different <em>g</em> 
							factors associated with the valley eigenstates lead to entanglement between valley and spin state, deteriorating 
							the purity of the qubit spin and causing dephasing of the spin state. This work describes an investigation into applying 
							a valley-aware shuttling strategy, as described in [3], onto an existing integrated circuit design of an ultra-low-power 
							cryogenic shuttling signal generator. Due to limitations in measuring device-specific valley maps, we use artificial 
							valley map datasets generated using a diffusion model from [4]. Using these simulated valley maps, we then apply an 
							optimizer that tunes the pulse shapes in the digital twin depending on the valley map experienced by the electron.</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 30px;">We advocate for this approach by demonstrating its feasibility 
							through modeling and artificial datasets. Tuning involves adjusting the parameters of the electronic circuit offered by 
							the cryogenic shuttling chip to achieve high shuttling fidelity by adjusting the pulses of the shuttling signal generator. 
							We plan to run the modeled shuttling control on our real cryogenic chip integrated with a qubit to verify the effectiveness 
							of the digital twin.</p>

					<button type="button" class="collapse">NeuroQD: A Learning-Based Simulation Framework For Quantum Dot Devices</button> 
					<div class="content"> 
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px;">Spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots are promising for scalable quantum 
							computing, yet progress in control system development is limited by the lack of simulators that are both realistic 
							and fast enough to interface with control systems in real-time. Physics-based solvers [1-5] offer high accuracy but 
							are too slow for real-time use. Faster, more qualitative models [6-9] ignore gate layout and heterostructure details 
							and struggle to capture device behavior from a cold-start.</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 30px;">Here, we present NeuroQD, a learning-based simulation and 
							emulation framework. NeuroQD interfaces with control software in real time and given a set of gate voltages, returns
							the device response with millisecond-scale latency. Moreover, NeuroQD can simulate device behavior in the grossly 
							mistuned and cold-start regimes. Our method leverages an empirical property observed in physics-based workflows, 
							enabling the training of a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) to model the 2DEG electrostatic potential from 
							gate voltages with high accuracy and throughput. On GPU, NeuroQD delivers >1000× speedup while maintaining >96% 
							agreement compared to our high-accuracy, physic-based baseline (COMSOL). Interfaced with the experimental control 
							stack, the simulator reproduces key tuning features and yields device metrics and behavior consistent with measurements 
							on real-world devices. Together, these results provide a practical path to safe, fast, and realistic <em>in situ</em> development, 
							and testing of quantum control hardware and software.</p>

					<button type="button" class="collapse">RF-Squad: A radiofrequency simulator for quantum dot arrays</button> 
					<div class="content"> 
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px;">Spins in semiconductor quantum dots represent a large-scale integration route for quantum
							computing hardware. Many efforts have been devoted to creating quantum dot array simulators, with an aim to better understand the 
							complexity of these systems as they scale up. Typically based on the well-established Constant Interaction Model (CIM), they often 
							fail to simulate realistic datasets or recreate important experimental details, such as the set up used to measure the device.</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 30px;">We present RF-Squad, a physics-based quantum dot array simulator capable
							 of realistically replicating the outputs of radiofrequency reflectometry measurements. Implemented in JAX, an accelerated linear 
							 algebra library, RF-Squad facilitates the simulation a double quantum dot in milliseconds at the CIM level.</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 30px;">A key feature of RF-Squad is the inclusion of advanced physical phenomena, 
							such as the use of tunnel couplings, the WKB approximation, Fock-Darwin states, different noise models and tunnel rates. Furthermore, 
							the code has been optimized and structured in a layered approach, giving users the flexibility to balance realism and computational 
							speed. In summary, RF-Squad enables efficient generation of large, realistic charge stability diagram datasets, and serves as a 
							practical tool for researchers to gain a deeper understanding of experimental data. Finally, with its user-friendly design, RF-Squad 
							is accessible to a broad range of users, making it easy to integrate across a wide range of experimental contexts.</p>

					<button type="button" class="collapse">Scalable Autotuning of High-Temperature Quantum Dot Spin Qubits</button> 
					<div class="content"> 
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px;">As quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are beginning to deploy in small arrays [1], achieving
							robust and scalable autotuning-particularly at elevated temperatures-remains a formidable challenge. A major hurdle arises from 
							trapped charges within the oxide layers, which induce random offset voltage shifts on gate electrodes, with magnitudes reaching 
							approximately 650mV in state-of-the-art devices[1]. While partial mitigation techniques exist, they typically necessitate prior 
							device characterization [2].</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 30px;">In this talk, we introduce a streamlined, five-step physically intuitive 
							framework for initializing and bootstrapping QD devices [3]. The most intricate step involves understanding the interaction between 
							screening and finger gates during the independent formation of conduction channels. To dissect this relationship, we employ coupled 
							Schr&ouml;dinger-Poisson simulations integrated with current continuity analyses, enabling us to identify optimal operating regimes
							within the device's high-dimensional gate voltage space.</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 30px;">These insights are synthesized into a unified autotuning protocol, allowing 
							for fully autonomous calibration and characterization. We demonstrate this methodology experimentally at 1.3K using an autotuner-BATIS 
							(Bootstrapping Autonomously Testing Initialization System)-to configure a quad-QD Si/SiGe heterostructure device.</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 30px;">We will also discuss our development of an open-source software platform 
							designed to facilitate the deployment and scaling of autotuning algorithms. This platform-agnostic approach addresses a critical 
							bottleneck in quantum dot scalability, paving the way for the broader implementation of large QD arrays.</p>

					<button type="button" class="collapse">Towards Scalable Robust Charge Transition Detection for Quantum Dot Devices</button> 
					<div class="content"> 
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px;">Reliable detection of charge transitions in charge stability diagrams (CSDs) is 
							a key requirement for the full automation of quantum dot device control. Performing this task directly at the cryogenic 
							stage reduces data transfer and supports scalability. To provide the large labeled datasets required for developing and 
							evaluating detection methods, we introduced Sim-CATS [1], a simulator that generates realistic CSDs including sensor responses 
							and distortions. We optimize both traditional and machine-learning-based detection methods using simulated data and benchmark 
							them on simulated and experimental measurements from GaAs and SiGe qubit devices. We also investigate the potential of model 
							compression and find its performance closely tied to task complexity, which can be alleviated by sensor dot compensation. In fact, 
							we find that sensor compensation allows machinelearning approaches to be reduced in size by up to two orders of magnitude while 
							maintaining, or even improving, detection quality. Together with high-quality measurements, this enables robust and scalable 
							(ray-based) charge transition detection. Finally, we estimate the cryogenic power budget for applying this approach to large-scale 
							systems with up to one million qubits.</p>

					<button type="button" class="collapse">Efficient Quantum Dot Tuning with Ray-Based Algorithms</button> 
					<div class="content"> 
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px;">As quantum processors scale to larger numbers of qubits, efficient and reliable tuning of
							quantum dots has become a critical challenge. To address this, we have developed automated algorithms that we integrated into our 
							Tuning Toolkit Framework (TTF).Within TTF, ray-based tuners have demonstrated the ability to tune QuBus devices from the depleted 
							state to the first electron transition in the single quantum dot (SQD) regime without human intervention, achieving success rates 
							above 75% within 30 minutes. Compared to the tuners that required twodimensional data for inspection, ray-based tuners required 
							substantially fewer measurements, reducing runtime, including measurement time and data analysis, by at least a factor of two. 
							Additionally, bootstrapping tuners, which perform accumulation and sensor coarse tuning, have been benchmarked on the Cryogenic Wafer 
							Prober (CWP), achieving success rates of approximately 90%. A dedicated sensor fine-tuner further stabilized sensors, transforming 
							disordered regimes into clean Coulomb oscillations in under half an hour. Our findings highlight ray-based tuning as a resource-efficient 
							and scalable approach to quantum dot control, enabling faster optimization and paving the way toward large-scale device operation.</p>

					<button type="button" class="collapse">Cloud API toolkit for tuning quantum dot devices</button> 
					<div class="content"> 
						<p style="margin-bottom:25px; padding: 0px;">Quantum dot automation has traditionally relied on bespoke heuristic tools and machine learning 
							models tailored to individual device architectures and noise profiles, limiting generalizability. With the advent of digital twins and 
							wafer-scale characterization, the availability of diverse training and test data is rapidly increasing. We present a suite of core analysis 
							and characterization tools that operate across device architectures and are instantly accessible via the cloud. This is the first cloud-based

					<button type="button" class="collapse">Control hardware with automated calibration software for quantum dots</button> 
					<div class="content"> 
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px;">Stand-alone tuning and stabilization protocols for spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots, often 
							based on physics-informed machine-learning or Hamiltonian estimating algorithms, have been successfully implemented, see for instance [1,2]. 
							Connecting these algorithms together in a user-friendly and time-efficient manner is key to reach effective initialization and calibration 
							protocols for the spin-based quantum processors of the future. Especially as scaling to large arrays introduces major calibration challenges: 
							resonance frequencies drift with charge noise, two-qubit couplings vary with cross-capacitance, and fidelities degrade if parameters are 
							not continuously optimized [3].</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 30px;">A software package that can implement the completely automated, and adaptive tuning
							and calibration graphs is therefore essential. The QUAlibrate software package from Quantum Machines [4] provides modular pipelines for tuning 
							and calibrating qubits, while keeping track of all essential qubit parameters. The already lab-proven algorithms can easily be connected
							together in a QUAlibrate workflow, allowing the efficient tune-up and calibration of quantum dot arrays. With interactive execution, live 
							visualization through a video mode tool, and robust data management, it is straightforward to keep track of the performance of separate 
							algorithms as well as the combination of them.</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom:5px; padding: 0px; text-indent: 30px;">Integration with DGX Quantum [5], developed by NVIDIA and Quantum Machines, extends
							these capabilities. GPU acceleration allows machine learning algorithms to be embedded into calibration loops, where neural estimators and 
							reinforcement learning agents can be utilized to find the processors operation points and optimize noisy multi-parameter landscapes. Together, 
							QUAlibrate and DGX Quantum provide a scalable, automated framework for the tune-up of spin qubit arrays, addressing one of the primary 
							bottlenecks in advancing toward fault-tolerant, industrial-scale spin-based quantum processors. [1]</p>

							of the spin qubit design, fabrication, verification, and measurement processes. As a vertically integrated organization and leader in 
							spin-qubit technologies HRL is uniquely positioned to provide software expertise in the creation of open-source, community focused tools 
							to address these problems and promote a healthy domestic spin qubit ecosystem. In this high-level talk, we will discuss the areas which 
							HRL would like to expand offerings and discuss some insights and challenges that must be overcome.</p>
